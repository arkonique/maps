Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
to install the required dependencies.

Then, run the following command to start the population sim:

```bash
python populations.py
```

Or open `map.html` to see the simplex noise based terrain generation.

Note that the climate sim and the voronoi based map generation are still in progress and not in a usable state (although I did try my best).
